Got their shrimp pad thai ($20) & their chicken khao soi ($18). The khao soi was honestly the best I've had! Soup was flavourful, the perfect amount of curry and coconut milk. For drinks, we got a pineapple shake ($6) and mango juice ($4) which was super refreshing .Lastly, we ended off with their mango sticky rice ($10). I reserved one month in advance on opentable for a table for 2 for a Sunday at 6pm. They're always super busy and lunch and dinner times are always full so make sure to reserve early!UsefulFunnyCoolJacqui L.Elite 2021Toronto, ON9048020858/2/2021Updated review12 photos2 check-insStill as good as it was 5 years ago.Pad Thai $18Pad See Ew $18Grabong $15.50Thai iced tea $6Sangria $11Everything we got was cooked and made to perfection. Great service and food has been consistently on point. I think my favourite main dish is now the pad see ew. Damn that thick noodle just hits the spot!Get the sangria, you won't regret this.See all photos from Jacqui L. for Pai Northern Thai KitchenUseful 1Funny 1Cool8/31/2016Previous reviewI don't usually eat Thai food but I'm so glad we checked out this place! Every dish is about $13-15 and you can add on different meats to change it up. I can't even begin to tell you what I got. Some form of rice with beef and fish sauce. My friend got the fried rice. My other friend got the coconut curry with noodles or something. Everything was delicious!!!! We also grabbed some starters, spring rolls and deep fried shrimp which was the best starters I've had in a long time! You have to get it. Oh and saving the best for last.... The Pai sangria $11 for a glass was on FIRE. HELL YES I'd pay for that. Expensive but yolo right? Sit out on the patio, enjoy a glass and eat good food with great friends. That's what it's all about.Read moreAsh S.Elite 2021Toronto, ON284827/31/2021Updated review1 photoAuthentic and very delicious Thai food. This time I was able to get a reservation for dine in, which was nice. Their Khao soi is slightly more watery than other ones I've had, but creamy and flavorful nonetheless. The pork rib soup was sour, spicy, and addictive; they don't skimp on the meat. I would actually recommend sitting inside rather than on their two patios, as the interior is beautifully decorated and outside can smell a little like sewer if the wind isn't blowing in your favorPapaya salad, Khao soi, pork rib + tomato soup (kanom jin nham ngeaw)Useful 2FunnyCool7/16/2021Previous reviewThe beef salad (plah nuah) was delicious: the beef was perfectly seared and juicy, the dressing was tangy and garlicky. They definitely don't skimp on the beef. Only gripe is it's a tad small for the price, but hey that's downtown!Got takeout but the service seemed friendly and efficient.Read moreAnnie P.Elite 2021Richmond Hill, ON21671489/10/20215 photosAuthentic Thai - AMAZING FOOD!  This is my husbands favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto (mine is Jatujak). We usually avoid going downtown, but PAI is the exception.  What we usually order: [Gai Satay Skewers] - These tender chicken skewers with a peanut sauce is an amazing starter [Morning Glory] - This is the best morning glory dish in the city! Always our go to order [Green Curry] - This is the dish that made PAI my husbands favourite Thai restaurant in the city. It is packed with flavour and very unique from other green curries as this one has a fishy taste to its curry sauce. [Khao Soi] - This one is one of my favourite Thai Dishes, and although they don't make it as well at Jatujak, their version is still pretty darn good.  Overall, Pai is a delicious authentic thai restaurant, serving up some amazing flavourful dishes. It does tend to get super busy here, so heads up!See all photos from Annie P. for Pai Northern Thai KitchenUsefulFunnyCoolBebita F.Toronto, ON18710/1/2021First time at this restaurant.Had heard from many people that is a must try place and it definitely did not disappoint. From the moment we walked in we were greeted and accommodated by all staff. They were very knowledgeable about their food and made great suggestions. But I cannnot say enough about the food.....wow soooo delicious  I would go back again and again.UsefulFunnyCoolMarco M.Richmond Hill, ON316287/31/20211 photoWent by a week or 2 after lockdown, dine in reservations were full, only walk-in first come first serve. Only waited about 20-30 minutes. First time experiencing Pai as a friend recommended this place. Thai milk tea was very nice just a hint too sweet for me but tasted quite authentic as I have been to Thailand. Also ordered PAD THAI, thai spicy. Very nice kick as I'm used to spicy foodNORTHERN THAI PLATTER Deep F fritters, barbecue pork skewers, Thai sausage served, tomato-pork relish,sticky rice.Useful 2FunnyCool 1Hannah C.Elite 2021ON, ON3332981947/8/2021Updated reviewLocated in the heart of downtown, this is definitely a hidden gem. Very down to earth, and a nice place to chill and dine with friends or family. They do also have a bar area for solo diners. I do not recommend this place if you are looking for a quiet romantic date. However if you seek an upbeat, busy yet savoury food, this is your go to. If you crave Thai food, their food here is flavourful and delicious. You can tell they use fresh ingredients to make a great meal. Definitely a must try for Thai cuisine.Useful 1FunnyCool 19/13/2018Previous reviewSuper long line-up for any day of the week. Definitely much better to go during lunch hour! The wait was long but it was worth it! Food is so fresh and has so much flavour! Pad Thai was rich in flavour with the perfect amount of exquisite sauce. The aroma for the coconut curry was a great reflection of its delightful taste. As for the khao soi, savoury with a gratifying after taste. It is definitely filling and delicious. Also, must try the Thai iced tea! As for the space, this place is huge with a very relaxed and down-to-eatery ambiance. I definitely recommend this location for anyone who enjoys to relaxed while enjoying a scrumptious Thai meal.Read moreJohn D.Elite 2021Toronto, ON2731234/2/20212 photosFor all you west side kids, Pai has a location in Etobicoke delivering through apps. Location: Pai EtobicokeDelivery: UberEatsI had to write my review before my words are slowly fleeting away..Ordered Khao Soi, coconut curry egg noodle, one tofu/veggie and one beef. Beef Khao Soi. There are 5-6 large chunks of beef. Tofu/Veggie Khao Soi. Broccoli and cauliflower were overcooked and broke upon touch. Despite the overcooked vegetables, the coconut curry was so rich, creamy, and flavourful. The egg noodle was a smaller portion than expected; the broth to noodle ratio was really skewed in the broth's favour. I really appreciated the following: Lime/green onions were packed into a small Dixie cup container. Fried noodles were plentiful, a whole sandwich bag full. Egg noodles were perfectly cooked and packed into a small round container. Would 100% reorder with a slight hope for non-overcooked broccoli and cauliflower. I hope the Pai Etobicoke location allows dine in once we return to a semi normalcy in the not so distant future.Tofu/Veggie Khao Soi.Beef Khao Soi.Useful 1FunnyCool 1Kareen N.Elite 2021Markham, ON10584627/8/2021Hm... I'm gonna try coming back here to get the full experience but for now I'm just going to comment on the food because I've only ever gotten takeout.I've only ever tried the Pad Thai here and you know what I have absolutely nothing bad to say about it. It checks off everything I want in a Pad Thai and this is the safest bet you'll get in Toronto. The only reason why I wouldn't give it five stars is cause I'm not particularly wowed by anything, if anything I feel every other Pad Thai place is like below standard and this one is the standard. My boyfriend also tried the green curry and he seemed to really like it. I tried a bite and it was quite refreshing and coconut-y but very filling. Can't wait to try this in house someday!UsefulFunny 1CoolPat C.Davis, United States211249/11/20213 photosCame here on Saturday at 1145 and a line has already started forming so come early! Waitress was very friendly and attentive. The best dish for me was the shrimp miang kum. Definitely a must! I'm surprised they have this here as it's a very niche thai dish - will definitely return for more! The platter is alright, I like the moo ping (pork skewers) the most. The laab (minced pork) tasted kinda soapy (?) Which is weird I'm not sure why but I didn't enjoy it too much. The fritters were crunchy and fun to eat. Last the beef salad was okay. It was a little dry, I wish there was more sauce or dressing because the dressing is really good. All in all it was very good and I would definitely come back to try the rest!UsefulFunnyCool1234567891 of 293883 other reviews that are not currently recommendedBusiness websitepaitoronto.comPhone number(416) 901-4724Get Directions18 Duncan Street Toronto, ON M5H 3G8Is this your business?Claim your business to immediately update business information, respond to reviews, and more!Claim This BusinessCollections Including Pai Northern Thai Kitchen10Toronto Weekly RoundupBy Yelp I.3030 Must Try Restaurants in Toronto, Winter 2019By Yelp I.40Toronto's Elite Of EliteBy Nimish H.15Authentic Thai/Malay/Vietnamese RestaurantsBy Danica C.11Beyond Pad Thai in TorontoBy Jennifer C.18Toronto Yelp Top 2020 PicksBy Tarah P.20Best In Class Across GTABy Wincy S.17Rosey’s Toronto Faves 🌟By Rosey L.136Toronto Top Dining, Eateries & Bars!By Charles N.8Downtown TO FavesBy Caitlin T.People Also ViewedKhao San Road1560$$ModerateThaiSabai Sabai Kitchen and Bar387$$ModerateLaotian, Thai, BarsSi Lom Thai Bistro169$$ModerateThai, Noodles, SeafoodKoh Lipe Thai Kitchen206$$ModerateThaiKiin194$$$PriceyThaiSalad King Restaurant948$$ModerateThaiBrowse NearbyRestaurantsNightlifeShoppingShow allDining in TorontoSearch for ReservationsBook a Table in TorontoOther Thai NearbyFind more Thai near Pai Northern Thai KitchenPeople found Pai Northern Thai Kitchen by searching for…Asian Food TorontoPai Toronto TorontoThai Food TorontoAboutAbout YelpCareersPressInvestor RelationsContent GuidelinesTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesDiscoverCollectionsTalkEventsThe Local YelpYelp BlogSupportYelp MobileDevelopersRSSYelp for BusinessClaim your Business PageAdvertise on YelpYelp for Restaurant OwnersTable ManagementBusiness Success StoriesBusiness SupportYelp Blog for BusinessLanguagesEnglishCountriesCanadaAboutBlogSupportTermsPrivacy PolicyCopyright © 2004–2021 Yelp\n",
